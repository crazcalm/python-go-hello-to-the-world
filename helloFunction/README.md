### Functions signature:
    - `def func_name(param_1, ... param_n):`
    - Python uses spaces (instead of brackets) to define scope.
    - functions can return one or multiple values.
      - In the case that nothing is expicitly returned, then "None" is returned
        
### Formatting strings:
    There are a few ways to go about formating strings in Python, but the
    prefered way is the use the str.format method.

    - In Python's interactive help, see topics STRINGMETHODS and FORMATTING.

### Lists:
    Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
    homogeneous items. For immutable sequences, see tuples.

    - In Python's interactive help, see topics LISTS and TUPLPES.
      - The TUPLES ducumentation is more informative...

### Cool Points:
    `if __name__ == "__main__":` Is called when you execute  the file, but it 
     is not called when you import that file.
