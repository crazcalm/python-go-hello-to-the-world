### Dictionary
	A *mapping* object maps *hashable* values to arbitrary objects.
    Mappings are mutable objects. See interactive help (DICTIONARIES).

### isinstance
	Is a useful way of checking if an object is of a certain type.
    See interactive help (isinstance)
### Exceptions
	Exceptions are raised, and python has a number of builtin exceptions that you can choose
    from, but, if you want, you can always make your own.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html?highlight=baseexception for the information about python's builtin exceptions.

### Testing
	Unittest, the testing library in python's standard library, is amazing! It has
    everything that you would every want or need in a generic testing framework. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html?highlight=testing for more information about how to use it.

### namedTuples
	Are tuples that have names for their items. I like using namedtuples for clarity. For instruction on how to use them, see the interactive help (collections.namedtuple)

## Cool points:
	- The python unittest framework has the ability to capture standard output so that you can test against it. When I first learned about this, my mind was blown.
