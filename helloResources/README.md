## Python
	- Interactive help
		- It is a beautiful tool that I use all the time.
	- Python docs
		- The website allows you to download the docs in html (and other formats). I usually
		  download them so that I can view them offline.
    - My favorite python book is the Python Cookbook! It is a great read!

## Go
	- "The GoProgramming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan
	- go doc tool
		- Once you get a sense of what packages exists, it becomes easier to use.
	- Golang.org
	- Go Time (podcast)
	- Go 1.7 testing changes(https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Subtests_and_Sub_benchmarks)
	- godoc
		- This tool alows you to bring up a local version of the Go websites. I have not
		  figured out how to get this working with Go Verson Manager, so I do not use it.
