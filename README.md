#Python and Go: Hello to the World

##Section1: Introduction

	The purpose of this talk is to give a brief tutorial of Python and Go while 
	also comparing their different approaches to solving similar problems.

	We will cover the following going through the following programs:
	- Hello World
	- Hello Function
	- Hello Friend
	- Hello Human Being
	- Hello Friends (JSON edition)
	- Hello Resources

##Section 2: Hello World

	In this section, I will present the standard “Hello World” program in both
	Python and Go. We will go over the basic syntax rules that are followed when
	creating a Python and Go project, and we will go over how to run these
	programs.

##Section 3: Hello Function

	In this section, we will modify the Hello World Program so that functions are
	used. We will take this moment to go over the syntax of how functions are
	created in both Python and Go. We will start off by creating a function that
	takes zero parameters, then 1 parameter, then an arbitrary number of
	parameters.

##Section 4: Hello Friends

	In this section, we will modify the “Hello Function” program to handle
	collections of friends (close friends, not so close friends, boys, girls, etc)
	while taking errors in consideration. While making these modifications, we will
	go over different approaches for storing data within a program. In terms of
	Python, we will go over storing our friends in lists and dictionaries and
	passing them to a function that can appropriately deal with those data
	structures. In terms of Go, we will create the same program using Go specific
	data structures, such as slices and maps.

##Sections 5: Hello Human Being

	In this section, we will acknowledge that our friends are more than just static
	data. Our friends are human beings with ages, likes, dislikes, spouses,
	children, jobs, and personalities. To make our friends more realistic, we are
	going to construct representations of our friends in Python classes and Go
	structs. At this point in time, we will take a moment to discuss Object
	Oriented Program in Python and Go and explain how these two languages
	accomplish the same goal by different means. In creating our Friend objects, we
	will internal and external method such as “Should I lie?” (internal), “Do I
	care?”(internal), “Say something” (external), and “Respond” (external).

##Sections 6: Hello Friends (JSON edition)

	In this section, we acknowledge that storing our friend in memory is not
	optimal in the sense that all of the date about our friends gets erased once
	the program shuts down. In order to solve this issue, we will  write our data
	to JSON, read our data from a file, and instantiating our classes and structs
	from this data. While doing this, we will go over imports and how to find
	packages in the Standard Library, as well as how to figure out what classes,
	methods, functions, structs exist in a package.

##Section 7: Hello Resources

	In this section, we will go over different resources for learning more about
	Python and Go.
